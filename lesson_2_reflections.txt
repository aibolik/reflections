What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I run git init, Git creates .git directory. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging are is something between working directory and repository. It's like a box, where we serve things to be transmitted.
We can add and remove items from it. And when we are done, we will transmit(commit) to repository.
