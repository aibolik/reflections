When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when I want my work to be on Cloud
- when I want to share it
- when I want others to contribute to my work


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe, to have a clean working directory.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - copy from one's remote repository one own remote repository.
Clone - clone repository from own remote repo to local repo.
Branch - create branch on repo.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If I am out of Internet I know what has been in remote branch, in last up-to-date state. Then for merging local and remote commits.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Collaborate without Git, I don't know. Maybe just share my piece of code I did. That would be much more harder. Of course Git is better, because
it was made for these purposes.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When implementing new feauter, bug fix, and etc. And when you are doing it in a team, or just want others to contribute to your work.
