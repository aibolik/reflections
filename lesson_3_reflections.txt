When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when I want my work to be on Cloud
- when I want to share it
- when I want others to contribute to my work


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe, to have a clean working directory.
