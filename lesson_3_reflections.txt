When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when I want my work to be on Cloud
- when I want to share it
- when I want others to contribute to my work


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe, to have a clean working directory.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - copy from one's remote repository one own remote repository.
Clone - clone repository from own remote repo to local repo.
Branch - create branch on repo.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

If I am out of Internet I know what has been in remote branch, in last up-to-date state. Then for merging local and remote commits.
